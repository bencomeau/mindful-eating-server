## Mindful Eating Server

Express server served at port 3000

### Starting for production

Start the server with `npm start`.

### Starting for development

To improve development experience, `nodemon` is installed as a development dependency. To get automatic reloading, you can start the server with `npm run start:dev`. This aliases `nodemon --exec npm start` to gain auto-reload on changes to the server.
